# Tableau---Coffee-Shop-Data

This project showcases an interactive Tableau dashboard I created to analyse patterns in customer reviews across different coffee store types and brands.

It demonstrates my ability to structure data, derive insights, and design clear visualisations in Tableau.

The .csv file contains raw review counts and store information.

The .twbx workbook includes all Tableau sheets, visualisations, and the assembled dashboard.

📊 Overview

The dashboard answers three key questions:

Which store types receive the most customer reviews overall?

Which individual stores/brands have the highest number of reviews?

What is the most common type of coffee store?

📌 Visuals in the Dashboard
Relationship Between Store Type and Reviews

A bar chart compares the volume of reviews across different types of coffee stores (Cafe, Coffee shop, Espresso bar, etc.).

It shows that Coffee shops and Cafes dominate the landscape, with certain brands receiving disproportionately high engagement.

Highlights the 20 individual stores/brands with the highest review counts.

This helped identify standout performers in terms of customer engagement.

⚙️ My Process

Here’s what I did in Tableau:

Connected to the raw dataset containing coffee store information and review counts

Cleaned field names and categorised store types

Created calculated fields where needed (e.g. grouping similar store types)

Built individual sheets for each visual (Sheets 2–4)

Assembled them into a single cohesive dashboard layout with interactive elements and labels

💡 Insights

Cafes are the most common store type overall

Coffee shops tend to attract the highest number of reviews

A few standout stores receive far more engagement than others, indicating strong brand recognition or customer loyalty
